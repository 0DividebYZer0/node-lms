    <h4>JavaScript 101</h4>
    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT compiled programming language with first-class functions.
      Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it,
      such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
      dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.</p>

    <h4>Learn Node.js</h4>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript
      code outside of a browser. Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which
      scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript
      engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools.</p>

      Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service,
      and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer,
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering
      patterns and paradigms</p>
